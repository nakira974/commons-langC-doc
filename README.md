* This JakartaEE 10 project created to provide a web server to the *[commons-langC repository](https://github.com/nakira974/commons-langC.git)*.
* It uses the very useful *[Ecplise JGit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/)* library to clone the library repository, then build with cmake the Doxygen documenation.
* The minimal API does the rest of the work.
